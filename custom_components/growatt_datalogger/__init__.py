"""The Growatt Datalogger integration.

Runs a TCP server that Growatt dataloggers upload to directly, replacing the vendor
cloud. No add-on, no broker, no compiled dependencies.

Note the deferred imports below. Home Assistant is pulled in inside the setup functions
rather than at module scope, so that importing this package does not itself require Home
Assistant. That is what lets ``protocol`` and ``registers`` -- which are deliberately
stdlib-only -- be imported, tested and audited on their own, since importing a subpackage
always executes its parent's ``__init__``. The type alias below is a PEP 695 alias and is
evaluated lazily, so it costs nothing at import time either.
