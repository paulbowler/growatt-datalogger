"""The TCP server dataloggers upload to.

A thin asyncio wrapper: accept a connection, reassemble frames, hand each to a
:class:`~.session.Session`. It holds no Home Assistant state, so the whole reply protocol
can be exercised against a fake datalogger with no event loop of Home Assistant's around.

Design notes worth keeping in mind when changing this:

* Reads are bounded by a timeout rather than left to block forever. Dataloggers ping
  every few minutes; ten minutes of silence means the peer is gone, and without a
  timeout a half-open connection leaks until the process restarts.
* Writes go through :meth:`_send`, which drains with a timeout. An implementation that
  never handles backpressure ends up busy-polling a permanently-writable socket set.
* Connection handler tasks are tracked and cancelled on shutdown.
